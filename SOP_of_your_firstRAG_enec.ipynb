It includes steps such as realigning the pump and motor if misalignment is found, addressing cavitation issues by checking suction strainers and minimum flow recirculation valves, replacing worn internal parts, and documenting all actions taken. Additionally, it outlines a pre-startup check before restarting the pump, emphasizing the importance of verifying all components are reassembled correctly and all necessary inspections are completed. The document also includes a controlled restart procedure after repair, which involves conducting a pre-start briefing, removing lockouts/tagouts, priming and venting the pump, starting auxiliary systems, performing a bump check for rotation, and starting the pump while monitoring closely.\n",
