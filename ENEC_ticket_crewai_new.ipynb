        "This code builds a fully autonomous support team simulation inside your notebook. Instead of just \"chatting\" with an AI, you are creating two distinct AI employees (Agents), giving them specific job descriptions, and providing them with a \"virtual office\" (the JSON and Markdown files) where they can do real work.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is the step-by-step breakdown of what is happening under the hood:\n",
        "\n",
        "##1. The \"Colab Fix\" (nest_asyncio)\n",
        "What it does: Google Colab (and Jupyter Notebooks) runs inside a Python \"Event Loop\" to manage its interactive cells. CrewAI also tries to start its own Event Loop to manage the agents. Normally, Python forbids running two loops at the same time. Why we need it: nest_asyncio.apply() patches Colab to allow these loops to run inside each other. Without this line, the code would crash with a RuntimeError before the agents even start.\n",
        "\n",
        "##2. Creating the \"Virtual Office\" (Data Generation)\n",
        "AI agents cannot hallucinate a database; they need files to interact with.\n",
        "\n",
        "tickets.json: This file acts as your company's database. It contains the \"problems\" (e.g., the CFO's broken token, the blue screen crash). We purposely include different types of data (SLA tiers, error codes) to test if the agents can read them correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "knowledge_base/: We create a folder with Markdown (.md) files. This simulates a company Wiki or Confluence page. It contains the \"answers\" (e.g., how to fix MFA issues).\n",
        "\n",
        "##3. Giving Agents \"Hands\" and \"Eyes\" (Tool Definitions)\n",
        "By default, an AI model (like GPT-4) is just a brain in a jar. It can't read your files. We solve this by creating Tools.\n",
        "\n",
        "TicketingSystemTool: This is a Python class that acts as an API.\n",
        "\n",
        "When the agent says \"I want to read the queue,\" this code actually opens tickets.json, reads the text, and sends it back to the agent.\n",
        "\n",
        "When the agent says \"I want to update status to resolved,\" this code writes that change into the JSON file.\n",
        "\n",
        "SimpleRAGTool: This simulates a search engine. When the agent asks for \"MFA help,\" this tool loops through the text files in the knowledge_base folder, counts matching keywords, and returns the most relevant file.\n",

        "We define two distinct personalities. This is called \"Role-Based Agent Architecture.\"\n",

        "\n",
        "Goal: Solve the specific problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "Capability: This agent has both tools. It takes the specific ticket assigned by the Planner, researches it, and pushes the fix.\n",
        "\n",
        "##5. Defining the Workflow (Tasks)\n",
        "We tell the crew exactly what to do, step-by-step.\n",
        "\n",
        "Task 1 (Triage): \"Read the queue and give me the ID of the most critical ticket.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Expected behavior: The Planner looks at the list, sees the \"Platinum/Critical\" tag on the CFO's ticket, and outputs TIC-IAM-002.\n",
        "\n",
        "Task 2 (Resolve): \"Take the ID from Task 1, research it, and fix it.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Expected behavior: The Analyst receives TIC-IAM-002. It reads the details, sees \"MFA Token,\" searches the Knowledge Base, finds the \"Time Sync\" fix, and updates the ticket.\n",
        "\n",
        "##6. The Execution (crew.kickoff)\n",
        "When you run support_crew.kickoff(), the magic happens:\n",
        "\n",
        "The Planner starts. It calls the TicketingTool, reads the JSON, thinks \"The CFO is angry, that's priority #1,\" and passes the ID to the next agent.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Analyst wakes up. It receives the ID. It calls the TicketingTool to get details. It realizes it doesn't know how to fix \"MFA.\" It calls the RAGTool. It gets the answer. It calls the TicketingTool again to write the solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Final Result:\n",
        " The script prints the final report, and if you open tickets.json in Colab's file viewer, you will see the status has actually changed to resolved."
